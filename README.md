# Geopolitical-Analysis-Energy-Demands

The project focuses on the geopolitical analysis for the energy demand across the world. After the Ukraine crises the world is findng itself in a rather vulnerable position in terms of energy requirements, 
Hence in this project we will focus on the various geographies around the world. This project is a part of udemy project however I will be adding on the insights and make changes according to requirements 
or anything that I find new according to the development.

The following libraries are used in this project

 1. Matplotlib
    
    Matplotlib, which is a Python library for creating 2D plots of arrays, is a powerful tool for visualizing data. It is built on NumPy arrays and is compatible with the broader SciPy stack. 
    Matplotlib was developed by John Hunter in 2002.

    Visualization is an effective way of presenting large amounts of data in an easily understandable format, and Matplotlib provides various types of plots such as line, bar, scatter, and histogram.
    
    
    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
  
    # x-axis values
    x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  
    # Y-axis values
    y = [10, 20, 30, 40]
  
    # Function to plot
    plt.plot(x,y)
  
    # function to show the plot
    plt.show()
